Camera Initialization: 
The camera needs two sets of drivers to work with ROS. First are the mvBlueFox USB 2.0 drivers. The USB drivers can be installed from the script provided on the manufacturers website. Second is the Bluefox2 ROS package. In order to use the camera with ROS, the Bluefox2 module needs to be launched. On this machine, the launch files are located in 
	~/catkin_ws/src/bluefox2/launch
To launch a single camera, the command is:
	roslaunch single_node.launch device:=30000337
TO launch both cameras:
	roslaunch multi_node.launch num_cameras:=2 camera0:=30000337 camera1:=26803584


To view the camera, we can launch an instance of rviz. To display the image topic, we need a display of type "Image." On the NUC these should be set up for both cameras. In the case that they are not, they can be added through the "Displays" subwindow.

A demo python ROS module has been set up in ~/catkin_ws/src/image_to_opencv/src
Any python code in that folder should be able to launch a ROS node named image_to_opencv
 
To set white balance to a cooler tone (4 is best but 1-6)
$rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam set /mv_26803584 wbp 4

Notes on dynamic camera config:
- wbp is an integer value that controlls the white balance. Default used to be 1, but has been changed to 4
- cbm is an integer value controlling camera orientation. 0 is the default value
- aec is an integer value enabling automatic exposure control. Apparently this has issues in multi camera systems, according to a warning in the bluefox2 driver. 0 is off, 1 is on. Default is 0
- ctm (?)
- dcfm (?)
- hdr I assume enables high dynamic range, but the visual result is the opposite of what I would expect. 0 or 1
- expose_us is an integer value controlling the number of microseconds each frame is exposed for. Default is 5000
- gain_db is a float, default of 0.0, that adjusts camera gain. Think of gain as artificially increasing the brightness of an image
- mm (?) Can only be adjusted in the launch file, not dynamically. Can't figure out what this one does, but the values 0 and 1 are valid. 0 is default.
