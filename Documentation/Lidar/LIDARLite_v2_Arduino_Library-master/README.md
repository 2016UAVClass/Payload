# LIDARLite_v2_Arduino_Library (BETA)

***NOTE:*** *This library is created specifically for LIDAR-Lite version 2 with the "Blue Label". See [http://pulsedlight3d.com](http://pulsedlight3d.com) for more information.*

This is an Arduino library for interaction and learning about LIDAR-Lite v2 "Blue Label". It is intended to be both a quick start (using the examples) and an education tool (LIDARLite/lidarlite.cpp is/will be well documented). Used in combination with our documentation (coming soon) this will help users get started quickly and explore all the possiblilites of LIDAR-Lite v2. 

## To Do:

- Create to-do list

Right now the following example files are complete with some comments: 

- Single Sensor/Distance_Single
- Single Sensor/Velocity_Single
- Single Sensor/Correlation_Record
- Single Sensor/Distance_as_Fast_as_Possible
- Single Sensor/Change_I2C_Address

More coming very very soon!
